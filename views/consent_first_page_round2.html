        <p>The HIT you are about to do is the second round of a 3-round experiment from Crowd Cognition Group at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Today you will proceed with round 2. As in the previous round, this round includes three blocks of 40 trials. At the end of today, you will get 5$ for sure. There is a separate bonus of up to 2$ which will depend on your performance. You will collect this bonus when you have completed round 3 of the experiment which will happen in 1 week. </p>
    
        <p>Today, your task is to learn a set of images and figure out how to earn a reward from each. More detailed instructions will be provided on the next few screens.</p>
        <p>This experiment has no anticipated risks. There are comprehension checks to make sure you understand the instructions.</p>
        <p>Only take this HIT on a laptop or desktop computer. Do NOT take this HIT on a mobile device (e.g., cell phone or tablet) otherwise we will not be able to pay you. Do NOT use the Internet Explorer.</p>
